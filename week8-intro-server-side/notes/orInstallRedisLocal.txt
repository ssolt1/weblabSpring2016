Installation
Download, extract and compile Redis with:
$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-3.0.7.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-3.0.7.tar.gz
$ cd redis-3.0.7
$ make
Hint: It's a good idea to run 'make test' ;)

The binaries that are now compiled are available in the src directory. Run Redis with:
$ src/redis-server
You can interact with Redis using the built-in client:
$ src/redis-cli
redis> set foo bar
OK
redis> get foo
"bar"
