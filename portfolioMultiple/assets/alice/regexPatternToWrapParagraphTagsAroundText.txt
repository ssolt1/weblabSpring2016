# ok these work in one direction, but need a place holder for the other opening tag.
:%s/\n$/<<</g
:%s/\n$/<\/p>/g

\f	Matches a page break/form feed character.
\p	Matches a newline (CR/LF) (paragraph) (DOS Files).
\r	Matches a newline (CR Only) (paragraph) (MAC Files).
\n	Matches a newline (LF Only) (paragraph) (UNIX Files).
\t	Matches a tab character.

# this is my first choice.
# search ^\n (front of newline (LF Only)), replace with opening |||<p> (the three pipes are just a unique place holder for the closing </p> tag)
:%s/^\n/|||<p>/g
# search for |||, replace with closing </p> and add \r (newline (CR Only))
:%s/|||/<\/p>\r/g

# these produce a simular result.
:%s/\n$/<\/p>|||/g
:%s/|||/\r<p>/g
